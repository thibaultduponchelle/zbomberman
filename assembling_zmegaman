zMegaman was written using spasm. You may need to make a few small changes if using other assemblers, particularly due to spasm's support to import .bmp files. If you want to use spasm, you can download it from here: [http://wabbit.codeplex.com/releases/view/45088]. If you're on Linux, you can check out the SPASM2 SVN and compile the latest spasm version. The program should assemble fine for either spasm version, though.

To make testing easy, we used TilEm2. You can download the source from here: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tilem/files/tilem/2.0/] or pull the latest code from the SVN: [svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/tilem/code/trunk tilem-code]. There are also other emulators available which are very accurate and have nice debugging features. Looking around you'll find something you like (and if not, let's hear your suggestions!).

There is another tool we made called archive.py which will change a bit in the executable (.8xp) file's header so that the calculator will place it into the archive. This way, you can send the files directly to archive (they won't both fit in RAM) and test. I used zStart's run from home feature along with a savestate with prgmZMEGAMAN written on the homescreen for quick testing, just press enter and the program is ready to go. To see the script i used for compiling/testing, see [compile.sh] in the [code_source] folder.

If you have any questions about the source (the documentation is a bit lacking, sorry!), how to compile it, want help using the engine in your own project, etc., please don't hesitate to ask us. You can write us at [z.oldsc001@gmail.com].
