This directory contains the zmegaman map editor designed with python and pygtk.

It basically works but it's hard to use if you're not the author (so if you read this README and want to use the map editor, good luck !).

This could be used for other projects probably but it's currently unstable.
I just done the minimum I needed in fact :)

In zmegaman, we use a RLE compressed data. In our case, compressed map are more than 2 times smaller!
